My visual will be composed of a butterfly, whose wings are filled with grabage. My intent in creating thius piece is that people will gaion awareness about the world's waste issue. Each year, millions of metric tons of garbage enter not only land, but sea too. All biotic species are at great risk. Recycling is not our solution, instead we as a civilization must work to reduce and reuse products so that the Earth may have a chance to recover. Recycling is one big illusion, and the vast majority of the population has no idea about this. As college students, we don't center ourselves around environmentalism, but maybe we should. All actions in our lifetime contribute to the problem at hand. By utilizing the specific aspects I chose for my project, I want people to see how we as humans have made the natural world ugly, and we must work to fix that. 
In my draft, you will see an original photo by me edited. I have cropped the image; upped the contrast and saturation; played with the gamma corrections a bit; used the erase tool to remove portions of the butterfly's wings; used the clone tool on the sky, butterfly, and flowers; and i also utilized photoshop's sky replacer, meaning that I did overlay a brighter sky that I blended with the preexisting clouds.
